This is my portfolio site / landing page. It includes a brief intro, a list of technologies I have used in my code journey, recent projects, and a link to my social & resume. Although I could have (maybe should have) built the entire site using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS, I instead built it in React, just for the sake of practice. For future stretch goals, I might convert certain elements into native web components sing Lit Elements, and also build a node.js server, and mongoDB backend... probably just to store and upload assets that are currently statically held. Again, not necessary, but should be fun!
