            I'm a software engineer, Atlanta resident, and recent graduate of General Assembly. 

I've been passionate about computers since a young age, and in 2020 I dedicated myself full-time to a career in tech.

My primary goals as a software engineer are to grow my skills, to build technologies that solve real problems in efficient ways, and one day provide easy ways for others to learn and use technology.
